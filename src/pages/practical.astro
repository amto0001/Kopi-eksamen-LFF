            Lost Farm Festival takes place from August 8-10, 2025, at Lost Farm HQ in Yderby, 
            a small hamlet surrounded by beautiful fields and the sea. The festival site opens on Friday, August 8th at 12:00 noon, with the program starting shortly after. 
            The festival concludes on Sunday, August 10th at 11:00 PM, and the campsite closes by 12:00 noon on Monday, August 11th. <br><br> Nearby, you’ll find Havnebyen (Harbour Town), 
            just a 20-minute walk or a 5-minute bike ride away. On Saturday, the town will host a special fishing competition in collaboration with the Mackrel Master, turning 
            the harbour into a lively sea of festivities. <br><br> NB: Space is limited. We only have room for 350 participants, and we therefore encourage you to buy your ticket now.

            We want you to enjoy all three days of the festival with us. Free tent camping is available at The Field, just next to Lost Farm HQ. We ask that you leave large party 
            tents and loud sound systems at home and opt for a modest-sized tent to share with the birds and nature. <br><br> While we encourage Lostfarmers to enjoy themselves, 
            please respect your fellow festival-goers, the local wildlife, and the surrounding land. Limited camper van tickets will be available closer to the festival, with more
             information to follow. There are also plenty of other options in the area if you prefer.
